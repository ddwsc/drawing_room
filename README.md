# Fun Drawing Room

## Clarify Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:

Collaborative Whiteboard:
- 30 users max per room.
- Real-time drawing collaboration.
- Changes should be visible to all users in real-time.

Real-Time Chat:
- Chat feature within each room.
- Support for both text and image messages.

Room Management:
- Users can create, join, and leave rooms.
- Persistent room sessions (past whiteboard states should be saved and retrievable).

Authentication:
- Verification user by email.
- JWT-based user authentication.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

Low Latency: Real-time collaboration should feel instantaneous with minimal lag.

Scalability: Should handle multiple rooms with up to 30 users each.

Security: Secure storage and communication (TLS, encrypted data).

## Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation

#### Users and Rooms:

Max users per room: 30

Rooms: Assume 150 active rooms at peak time.

Total users = 150 rooms * 30 users = 4500 concurrent users.

#### Data Estimation:

Whiteboard data per room (active session):
- Assume each action (e.g., drawing a line, adding text) is around 1 KB.
- Average of 1000 actions per session: 1000 KB or ~1 MB per active session.
- 150 rooms * 1 MB = 150 MB of whiteboard data in memory.

Chat Messages:
- Average message size (text): 100 bytes.
- Assume 2000 messages per session.
- Storage: 2000 messages * 100 bytes = 200 KB per session for text chat.
- If 20% of messages include images (100 KB each): 400 images * 100 KB = 40 MB for images per session.
- Total chat data per room: ~50 MB.
- For 150 rooms: 150 rooms * 50 MB = 7,5 GB of chat data.

Traffic:
- WebSocket Messages:
    - Assume each user performs 10 actions/minute.
    - For 30 users: 30 * 10 = 300 actions/minute per room.
    - 150 rooms: 150 * 300 = 45,000 WebSocket messages per minute (~750 messages per second).
- Data Storage:
    - If we store chat and whiteboard data for sessions: around ~8 GB/day.

### APIs Design

#### Authentication APIs:
- POST /api/v1.0/sign-in: Authenticate users.
- POST /api/v1.0/sign-up: Register a new user.
- POST /api/v1.0/verify: Verify a new user via email.
- POST /api/v1.0/reset-password: Reset user's password via email.
- POST /api/v1.0/change-password: Change user's password.

#### Room Management APIs:
- GET /api/v1.0/room: Get list rooms.
- POST /api/v1.0/room: Create a new room.
- POST /api/v1.0/room/join: Join an existing room.
- POST /api/v1.0/room/leave: Leave an existing room.

#### Whiteboard APIs:
- POST /api/v1.0/whiteboard/action: Broadcast whiteboard actions.
- GET /api/v1.0/whiteboard: Retrieve saved whiteboard state.

#### Chat APIs:
- POST /api/v1.0/message: Send a text message.
- POST /api/v1.0/file: Send a file message.

### Data Model Design

![database](public/database.png)

### High-Level Design

Frontend: Web-based interface for whiteboard and chat (React).

Backend: Node.js with Express for handling API requests and WebSocket server for real-time communication.

Database: MySQL for structured data.

Cache: Redis for caching data.

Message Queue: Kafka to handle event streaming and message queuing. (Not implemented yet)

File Storage: GCP Buckets for storing files.

### Detailed Design

WebSockets for Real-Time Collaboration:
- WebSockets will be used for real-time drawing and chat communication.
- Each room will have its own WebSocket connection to handle whiteboard updates and chat messages.

Backend Design:
- Node.js/Express will handle REST API requests for user management, room creation, and session storage.
- Socket.io will handle real-time collaboration on the whiteboard and chat.
- Kafka integration: Kafka topics will be created per room for managing events. Each room has its topic for handling whiteboard updates and chat.
- Redis integration: User's information will be saved for each login session.

MySQL Design:
- MySQL provides consistency in storing chat and whiteboard actions.
- Indexes: Indexes will be placed on frequently queried columns such as room_id and user_id for fast access to session data.

File Storage:
- Files in Chat: When a user uploads a file, itâ€™s stored at GCP Storage. The file URL is saved in MySQL. The file title will be use as a key to store in Redis and expire after 10 hours.
